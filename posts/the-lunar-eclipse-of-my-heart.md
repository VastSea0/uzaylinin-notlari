# A Lunar Eclipse of my Heart
Do you remember those days? That first day? And me? You know, I remember it like yesterday, without even remembering yesterday. Don't mind my fault, I thought wrongly of you that morning in my drowsiness. Yet I always thought wrong. Don't mind my fault. Let me be like time in this letter; let me start from the past towards the future — towards our non-existent future.

You planted a live bomb inside me, it was bound to explode one day. Ah, if only you had heard the storms and their flowers inside me. My feelings started at that moment. That morning, in that school desk... When did it end, or did it end at all, I don't know. I lived with you for months, do you know? It was inside me, they stirred every moment. I was barely holding myself back. Saying "I love you" to you was forbidden to me. I stayed silent.

Do you know how many dreams you were in? Do you know that I gave you my everything? Did you see the storms inside me, or not? I wondered; will you understand.

One day came, you wanted to tell me something. "Secret," you said. If only you could have seen what happened inside me at that moment, that pain and excitement which left me with only pain. "I fell in love with an angel," you said. That's when I understood lying and succeeded at it too: not showing a single piece of my disappointments. At that moment, I silenced myself. I punished myself. I became my own killer. I just stayed silent and made it my duty to unite you with your angel, thinking that maybe then I too would find peace — at least that's what I thought.

But it didn't happen. You gave up first, and I just watched you from behind. But do you know what was most painful? Not your love for another. What hurt me so much was you showing me my place in your life. That moment I understood my place and learned how that place could be filled. I thought I was special, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. But you gave that special secret to another too, and at that moment it wasn't a secret anymore, be sure of that. Count how many pens broke at that moment too, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart.

Do you know what I saw, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart? Do you know what I watched? Your distancing from me, putting others in my place, and my non-existent value to you. All the fault was mine actually, I knew I would get caught in this river and I didn't prevent it either. I don't know why but believe me, I wanted the impossible just for you, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. I saw that you were even making fun of and playing with me now. I stayed silent with the pain inside me.

But before, I would come to you. Do you know, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, how many of my dreams came true beside you? I was like in a dream, and in the end, I fell too.

Do you remember the day you drew me, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart? The day you showed me... Did you see, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, the happiness inside me? And did you hear those sentences I never said to you? Where is that picture, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart? Do you remember?

I'm leaving this city now, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart.

I'm just learning, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, you thought it was a joke. You didn't believe until I left, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. I left a city with you, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, and I wanted to forget you, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. My pain and my experiences but most importantly you, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. I couldn't accept this defeat before you. My surrender and my end. Everything burned, turned to ash at that moment. So... And I left, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. How many nights did I cry? How many lakes filled with my tears? The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, I would have wanted you to hear, wanted you to see but I had gone. I said everything is over now and it was.

I left, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. From the city and from your side. I put cities and people between us so that I would forget. But it didn't work. Never.

Well, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, why did you remind me of yourself again? Why? You came back now but you're still far away. I wonder if you want me to be your friend this time? Although you said "You're a good friend," I don't know, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart. You came to me again, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, and brought your storms. I'm crying and writing now, The Lunar Eclipse of my Heart, with nothing in my hand and I see, nothing has changed. And I know it won't change. Neither will you love me nor will you know me.

Yet I stayed in this cursed city, I'm completely alone. Completely alone.
Please don't make me relive those old days.
