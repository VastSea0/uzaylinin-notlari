Hello, everyone! Welcome to my new YouTube channel. I’ll be creating English content here because I’m learning English and want to improve my skills. First, let me introduce myself. My name is Egehan, I’m 15 years old, and I live in Kahramanmaraş, Turkey. My main hobbies are software development, reading books, and listening to music. I also enjoy trying out new things.

This channel is a way for me to improve my English while sharing interesting topics with you. I hope it can also help others who are learning English too!

I’ll be making videos about my daily life, book reviews, and sharing some software projects. I hope these videos can inspire others who are also passionate about these areas.

Learning English has been a fun but challenging journey for me. I’m excited to improve my skills and see where this journey takes me.

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions for future videos. I’d love to hear your ideas!

Thank you for watching! I hope you enjoy the videos I’ll be sharing here. Don’t forget to like and subscribe if you want to join me on this journey!
